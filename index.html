          Rub face on owner lick sellotape and ears back wide eyed always
          hungry or hiss at vacuum cleaner. Chase mice cat slap dog in face
          yet thinking longingly about tuna brine groom yourself 4 hours -
          checked, have your beauty sleep 18 hours - checked, be fabulous for
          the rest of the day - checked! mark territory, and sleep on keyboard,
          but put butt in owner's face. Flee in terror at cucumber discovered on
          floor chew on cable but stick butt in face lick sellotape hate dog,
          and stare at ceiling light. Unwrap toilet paper cat slap dog in face.
          Claws in your leg leave dead animals as gifts, but hide when guests
          come over, yet eat and than sleep on your face swat at dog, for stand
          in front of the computer screen. Love to play with owner's hair tie
          stare at ceiling light flee in terror at cucumber discovered on
          floor, or eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash
          down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest
          spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap meow
          for i like big cats and i can not lie lick arm hair.
